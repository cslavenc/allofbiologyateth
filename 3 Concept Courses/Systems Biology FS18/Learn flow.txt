NOTES
where do i use which model (topological, stoichiometric, kinetic, boolean) under which conditions
examples for these models
what is challenge 1 and 2 about: Chall_1 = [mechanistic/dynamic + globale network/steady state] challenge
techniques to identify networks (like 13C, MS etc)
Predict behavior from component concentrations. Which methods do you know?
When is a perturbation desired?

QUESTIONS WITH ELLA
W2/42: What are explanations when no acceptable flux fit to the data can be achieved?
W4/18: How do we get from 105 to 51 reactions only, that is how do we remove redundant reactions exactly?
W9/02: 4 questions on MS from self study (answer as prep)
W9/45: How can we exactly know where a phosphate is attached to a peptide and how to separate it from other phosphopeptides
================================================================
7.6.2018
started going through slides.
W0: doesnt seem to be that important
W1: same - maybe look at minimal no. of C-molecules for building (11 in total)
started with overview notes summary ("Essence of SB"). W2 done.
