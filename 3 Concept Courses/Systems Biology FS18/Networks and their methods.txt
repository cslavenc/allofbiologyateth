--- NETWORKS AND THEIR METHODS ---
[dont forget to mention MS, HPLC etc. where necessary]

Protein-Protein network
Time    : mins to hours to days (only for functional and structural functions)
Network : directed graphs (Boolean ODEs or Boolean network)
Elements: nodes = protein; edges = ligand binding, rate constants
Analysis: MS/MS or HLPC before MS to sort proteins (can also be modified); discovery or targeted.
Special : Hubs (multi protein complexes that have many potential interaction partners)
Protein-Protein interactions can also be transient (time scale smaller). Then, they need to come off again.


Signalling network
Time    : ms to sec (fast)
Network : directed graphs
Elements: nodes = receptors, ligands, second messengers, phosphorylating agents etc.; edges = strength of binding
Analysis: MS/MS (must have a way to freeze the binding such that ligand-target is together)
          FRET: to study the way and interaction partners of a ligand (or receptor if conformational changes occur)
Special : Often connect different networks functionally together.
Signalling networks are involved in regulatory networks. They also contain feedback loops, since the ligand has to come
off again (not so much the case as in protein-protein or metabolite networks - these are mostly linear).


Genetic network
Time    : hours to days to lifetime (constitutively active genes)
Network : Mostly undirected graphs or directed graphs if known (Boolean network)
Elements: nodes = genes, DNA-interacting molecules: proteins/metabolites; edges = a line (unknown or known interaction)
Analysis: Synthetic lethality in yeast (or other model organism), suppression analysis, deletion/insertion of transgene
          (CRISPR), RNAi for graded measurements
Special : Link inference is based on known interactions and non-interactions with a suitable similarity function (tensors).
Genetic networks are on a more general note molecular networks. Deletion/insertion implicitly encodes TRUE/FALSE.
mRNA networks have a bigger spectrum regarding activity states (translational bursting).


Functional network
Time    : all time scales
Network : mostly undirected
Analysis: Boolean ODEs, ...
Elements: nodes = actuators: genes, molecules, outside effects; edges = strength of interaction (number)
Special : Functional networks exist theoretically. Its basis are all other networks. Functional networks connect seemingly
	  unrelated networks across organs, organisms and even habitats. In systems biology, it is only concerned with
	  organ level at most (e.g. diabetes: liver, lipid/glucose metabolism, muscle cells and other cells, genes).
	  Often, there is a hub protein/metabolite/gene that is involved in different process and thus is a node for
	  several networks and contexts.

Protein/metabolite-DNA network
Time    : hours
Network : directed (activation/inhibition)
Analysis: Fluorescence for tracking, Boolean ODEs/networks for computation
Elements: nodes = DNA/genes, proteins/metabolites; edges = interaction type
Special : Regulate physiological changes in cells and transcription with TF.


Metabolic network
Time    : ms to mins
Network : directed graph
Analysis: FBA, MFA, 13C isotope labelling
Elements: nodes = metabolites/enzymes; edges = strength of interaction
Special : a quick perturbation in a complex system of a metabolite (increase of flux) allows us to model the situation
	  with approx. constant time if all other changes take a much longer time.
	  One can perform pertubation experiments by adding a new metabolite that activates another pathway and measure
	  the response. Thus one can generate a hybrid model that describes the normal and perturbed case equally well
	  (Pareto surface).
FBA: interaction-based model (needs stoichiometry and steady state such that obj. function can be optimized with MM).
No information about concentration only about their rate conversions (flux). Output gives any mathematically sound solution
!= biologically sound solution => constraints and right obj. function needed.
MFA: mechanism-based model (needs stoichiometry and k-values), good for dynamic models (growing cells/changing conditions).
Gives information about absolute concentrations. Output is more biologically sound, but computationally expensive.


RNAi network
Time    : hours to lifetime (depends on implementation: if in genome, then life; else if in vector, then hours to months)
Network : directed graph (inhibition)
Analysis: Any method, since it influences proteins (mRNA does not produce protein) -> observe mutant phenotype
Elements: nodes = si/miRNA, mRNA (main target) - protein (downstream target); edges = interaction type
Special : RNAi networks are similar to functional networks in terms of thinking.


Complex-Common Disease networks
Time    : ms to lifetime
Network : undirected mostly
Analysis: Depends on level: GWAS for genes, FBA, epidemiological study, association study, RNAi, CRISPR
Elements: nodes = every previous node; edges = functional, statistical inference via a similarity measure.
Special : Makes heavy use of statistical methods and requires large data samples.
	  Mono- and dizygotic twin studies needed to obtain concordance (environmental contribution on disease phenotype)
Complex = polygenetic disease with substantial environmental influence. Common = 1 in 1000 persons affected.

FURTHER NOTES
Boolean networks fail for networks with varying time scales, but they can still give insights into systems behaviour.
Boolean networks fail in signalling networks, RNAi networks and disease networks amongst others.
mRNA has a half-life time of 2 mins. Its degradation is already initiated after 1 min.
