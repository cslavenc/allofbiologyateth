Dopamine is the main neurotransmitter in the reward system. This system promotes the survival and reproduction of an organism and a species. Out of initial random movements, an organism develops a goal-oriented behaviour to obtain a pleasant reward. At the core of the reward system lie the ventral tegmental area and the nucleus accumbens. These brain structures are indispensable for all functions related to a motivation, learning and reward-seeking. Dopamine influences these processes also in further brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala where it is involved in different types of fear learning, extinction, associative learning and reversal learning amongst others.
