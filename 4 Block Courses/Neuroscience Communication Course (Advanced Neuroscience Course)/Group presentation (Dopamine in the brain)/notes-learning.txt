Prefrontal Dopamine in Associative Learning and Memory
Neuroscience. 2014 December 12; 282: 217–229. doi:10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.09.026.

PFC plays an initial role in associative learning. It receives DA projections from BG.
PFC DA needed for early stage of learning, but PFC-BG-loop does not happen when learnt
behaviour becomes a habit.
PFC DA neurons involved in reward-prediction (RPE) (motivational value). PFC DA neurons have phasic spikes.
The PFC spikes are slower than in striatum (=> striatum instructs PFC to look for more abstract rules).
PFC associative learning is further influenced by serotonine and noradrenaline
=> not 100% clear what DA neurons perform. Reversal learning (explain what it is) is not affected by
depletion of orbitofrontal DA, because mainly modulated by serotonin.
Experiments performed in monkey (visual cues).
D2 receptors may also contribute to motivation in the PFC. 

REVERSAL LEARNING: Learn that a previously associated rewarding stimuli is no longer rewarding (basically,
learn the opposite of the past to a stimuli that was positive).
