Estradiol, Dopamine and Motivation
Cent Nerv Syst Agents Med Chem. 2014 ; 14(2): 83–89

Gonodal hormones play a role in motivation => increase in female DA levels in NAcc with estradiol, no change in males.
Women probably more susceptible to cocaine than males due to sex differences.
=> motivation via DA is partly influenced by sex.

Differential Dopamine Release Dynamics in the Nucleus
Accumbens Core and Shell Reveal Complementary Signals
for Error Prediction and Incentive Motivation
The Journal of Neuroscience, August 19, 2015

Phasic DA release encodes different processes and the release happens in different regions of NAcc:
NAcc core: RPE (learning based theories)
NAcc shell: incentive salience (reward based theories)
=> There is a difference in the neurobiological substrate. NAcc is active in both types though.
=> Core DA release tracks prediction error, shell DA tracks motivationally salient stimuli.
SL and TL (lever task) used to show differences.
(last part of discussion also deals with addiction: abstinence based craving is of NAcc shell type).
