leak current

where does the action potential originate
: AXON HILLOCK
knowing simple receptors

what is analogue and what is digital
which drug acts on what


compare electrical and chemical synapse

hebbs postulate


drain of transistor etc
: drain is just the sink, it's where the current goes to (much like a water sink in the kitchen)
which is (maybe) an unconnected/open line in a schematic
