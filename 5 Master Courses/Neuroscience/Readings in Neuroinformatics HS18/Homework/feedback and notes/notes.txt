limitation: abstract 200 words +/- 50 words

Leave the reader with a positive impression after reading the abstract.

Notes to write better abstracts:
1) Intro to background
2) Problem definition
3) Proposed solution
4) Methods and results
5) Impact
6) Style + Understanding + words (overall grade)
Each of these points gives either 0, 0.5 or 1 point

(for the lecturer, also include number of words)

FEEDBACK
{If possible it is nice to keep the introduction less abstract.
Write more accessible.
It is important to state clearly what the new 
contributions of the presented work are and what methods they used.
Be careful keep the story more consistent, e.g. if you say the problem is the mathematical analysis and
this is what they provide in this paper, then this should also be continued/explained in the later sections.
}

it becomes more clear if you separate the two concepts/statements: 1) “this-and-this is the current
problem”. And then: 2) “In this work we are proposing the following solution to this problem”.
Don’t forget to also indicate the impact of the presented work.

Anything that is not crucial, should be removed. (every words counts)
Don't become too specific this means.
Don't go back and forth (avoid talking about something, then something else, then go back etc.).
Use "we" when talking about "we propose..." etc.
Introduction (in paper/general): state the state-of-the-art and problems and how it was solved.

"However" in papers is often to introduce the problem.
